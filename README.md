# Zork-Time traveller
This is an exercise for programming II in the UPC, we're developing our own Zork.

It is played basically as he original Zork. 

Use:
-"go"+ "direction you want to go" to move around the map(you'll find the map in a jpg in the repository)
-"look" to see again the description of the current room.
-"help" to see the comands you can use(ingame).
-"close/open door" to close or open the door.
